        <h2>Google Gemini Will Be Multimodal</h2><br>
        <p>Pichai stated that Gemini combines the strengths of DeepMind’s AlphaGo system, known for mastering the complex game Go, with extensive language modeling capabilities.Google Gemini AI is a factual language model from Google AI, trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It is a large language model (LLM) chatbot that can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. Gemini AI is still under development, but it has learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including following instructions, answering questions, and generating creative text formats.

            Gemini AI is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as education, research, and entertainment. For example, it can be used to create personalized learning experiences, generate new ideas for research projects, or even write creative content for books, movies, and video games.</p><br>
        <p>He said it is designed from the ground up to be multimodal, integrating text, images, and other data types. This could allow for more natural conversational abilities.</p><br>
        <p>Pichai also hinted at future capabilities like memory and planning that could enable tasks requiring reasoning.</p><br>
        <h2>Gemini Can Use Tools And APIs</h2><br>
        <p>In an update to his professional bio over the summer, Google Chief Scientist Jeffrey Dean said Gemini is one of the “next-generation multimodal models” he is co-leading.</p><br>
